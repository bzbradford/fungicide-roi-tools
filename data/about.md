### Fungicide ROI Calculator

This tool helps farmers and agronomists evaluate the economic potential of fungicide applications for field crops by estimating the expected net benefit of fungicide applications based on economic modeling of multi-year, multi-location field trial results conducted across the US Midwest. Estimates are based on historical trial data and actual results may vary. These tools are offered free of charge and the developers, associated institutions and funding agencies cannot guarantee accuracy. Users assume all risk. Consult with your local extension professionals before making spray decisions.

#### How to Use

1. Select your crop using the tabs at the top
2. Enter your expected yield and sale price
3. Select the anticipated late season disease severity level
4. Adjust treatment costs to local pricing or leave at U.S. median defaults
5. Review the results in the charts and data table

#### Key Metrics

* **Expected net benefit:** Estimated profit or loss: `yield_benefit * price − treatment_cost`
  * Where: `treatment_cost = program_cost + application_cost * number_of_applications`
* **Breakeven probability:** Probability that applying the fungicide yields positive net benefit
* **Breakeven cost:** Maximum program + application cost that still expects to break even based on the expected benefit of the program and expected sale price
* **95% confidence intervals:** Range of plausible values based on model uncertainty

#### Interpreting Results

* Programs are ranked by expected net benefit (highest first)
* Higher ranked programs are expected to be more likely to increase yield and return a profit, but real-world results may vary
* Error bars (when shown) indicate the 95% confidence interval for the expected net benefit calculation
* Negative values (red shaded area) indicate expected loss

#### Assumptions

* Yield response based on linear regression of field trial data
* Disease severity affects yield loss proportionally
