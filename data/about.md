### Fungicide ROI Calculator

This tool helps farmers and agronomists evaluate the economic potential of fungicide applications for field crops.

#### How to Use

1. Select your crop using the tabs at the top
2. Enter your expected yield and sale price
3. Select the anticipated disease severity level
4. Adjust treatment costs if different from defaults
5. Review the results in the chart and data table

#### Interpreting Results

* Programs are ranked by expected net benefit (highest first)
* Blue points indicate the top 3 recommended programs
* Error bars show the 95% confidence interval
* Negative values (shaded area) indicate expected loss

### Economic Analysis Methodology

This calculator estimates the expected net benefit of fungicide applications based on field trial data and economic modeling.

#### Key Metrics

* **Expected net benefit:** Estimated profit or loss: (yield × price × yield_benefit) − treatment_cost
* **95% confidence intervals:** Range of plausible values based on model uncertainty
* **Breakeven probability:** Probability that applying the fungicide yields positive net benefit
* **Breakeven cost:** Maximum spend that still expects to break even

#### Assumptions

* Yield response based on linear regression of field trial data
* Disease severity affects yield loss proportionally
* Base cost per application is the same for all programs

#### Data Sources

Economic parameters are derived from multi-year, multi-location field trials conducted across the Midwest.

#### Disclaimer

Estimates are based on historical trial data. Actual results may vary.
